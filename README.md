# Rob Wood: Senior Systems Architect & Engineer • IT Transformation Strategist • Exceptional Problem Solver • Full-Stack Firefighter

<a  href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/virtualstyle?trk=profile-badge">Rob on LinkedIn</a></div>

I’m a full-stack systems engineer, cloud architect, and problem-solver with 20+ years of building software that makes businesses run better. My background spans everything from scrappy mom-and-pop shops to global enterprises - designing AWS architectures, automating CI/CD, modernizing legacy platforms, and shipping resilient systems that stay fast, secure, and quietly reliable. My approach is simple: eliminate inefficiency, reduce risk, and build technology that pays for itself.

I’ve led large-scale transformations, built serverless platforms, architected multi-account AWS organizations, mentored engineering teams, and reimagined legacy products into modern SaaS platforms, including work that secured multimillion-dollar contracts and doubled client bases. Whether reducing complexity by 75%, improving performance by 4x, or scaling high-traffic systems to massive loads, my focus is always on measurable impact and long-term value.

Now running virtualStyle full-time, I combine enterprise-level engineering with a local, human touch, making advanced technology accessible to small businesses and entrepreneurs who need practical solutions, not jargon. I help clients cut costs, automate processes, streamline operations, and build systems that keep improving over time. Some want fully managed solutions; others want DIY-friendly systems with clear training. Either way, I build technology that empowers, not intimidates.

If you need someone who can architect the big picture, execute the details, and translate complex technical problems into straightforward, actionable solutions, you’ll find I work fast, communicate clearly, and deliver results you can trust. Based in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, I’m committed to using technology to strengthen local businesses, unlock opportunity, and give this region a competitive edge in a digital world.
